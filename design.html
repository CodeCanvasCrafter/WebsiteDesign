   <p>Pakistan began its nuclear efforts during the 1950s as an energy program.</p>
     <p>It was prompted in large part by the United States’ “Atoms for Peace” program, which sought to spread nuclear energy technology across the globe.</p>
     <p> In 1956, the Pakistani government created the Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) to lead the new program.</p>

<p>The United States gave Pakistan its first reactor—the five megawatt Pakistan Atomic Research Reactor (PARR-1)—in 1962.

During this early period, PAEC chairman Ishrat Usmani devoted government resources to training the next generation of Pakistani scientists. </p>
<p>In December 1974, however, the course of the Pakistani bomb drastically changed with the return of German-trained metallurgist Abdul Qadeer Khan, more commonly known as A. Q. Khan. </p>
<p>He had spent the previous four years working for URENCO, a nuclear fuel company, on uranium enrichment plants in the Netherlands and brought his vast knowledge of gas centrifuges to Pakistan.</p>
